## Available Scripts

Install the dependencies:

```

```
npm run start
```

Navigate to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). You should see the app running. Edit a component file in `src`, save it, and reload the page to see your changes.

## Building

To create an optimised version of the app:

```
npm run build
```

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
The app is ready to be deployed!
